# 🐉 Augmented Reality Dragon Tracker (Unity + AR Foundation)

An interactive **Augmented Reality (AR)** project built using **Unity** and **AR Foundation**, where scanning a real-world image spawns a **3D Dragon** that can be controlled using an on-screen **joystick**! Perfect for beginners exploring AR development and mobile-based interaction 🚀

## 🕹️ Interaction Flow

1. 🖼️ **Scan Image** → The app detects a reference image (e.g., Game of Thrones poster).
2. 🐉 **Dragon Spawns** → A dragon model appears above the image in AR.
3. 🎛️ **Use Joystick** → Move the dragon around using the on-screen joystick.
4. 📐 **Physics & Rotation** → The dragon moves naturally and rotates toward the direction of movement.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔍 AR Image Tracking
- Unity’s `AR Tracked Image Manager` listens for image detection.
- When the target image is found, it triggers the `PrefabCreator` script.
- The dragon prefab is instantiated with a slight vertical offset.

### 🐉 Dragon Control Logic
- `DragonController` script reads input from the joystick.
- Movement is handled via Unity physics using `Rigidbody`.
- Rotation ensures the dragon faces the direction it’s moving.

### 🛠️ Android Configurations
- ✔️ Switched platform to Android in Build Settings
- ✔️ Enabled ARCore in XR Plugin Management
- ✔️ Set API Level ≥ 24
- ✔️ IL2CPP & ARM64 architecture for performance
